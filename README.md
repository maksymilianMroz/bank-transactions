<h1 align="center">Hi there :fire:</h1>
<h3 align="left">This is a short instruction how to turn on this app:</h3>
<br />
- download this repository to your computer
- download the repository with the database (https://github.com/maksymilianMroz/db-holder) - on the json-server
- on both, run the ``npm install`` command
- on the task repository then use the ``npm run server`` command
- in the repository with the application use ``npm start`` -> the application should start on port 3000
<br />

<h3 align="left">Things to do:</h3>

I am totally aware that many things could have been done better - a few things are missing:

- components could be broken down into smaller ones (both in the table and the form)
- create more atoms: buttons, inputs or text drawers
- the pagination itself could have been done by yourself, not using a ready-made solution
- improve styles
- write more tests (at the moment, only two basic tests are run with npm test)
- work on the folder structure
